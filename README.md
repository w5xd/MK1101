# MK1101 through MK1104
Morse generation and single-operator-on-2-Radios controller<br/>
Much more information and complete instructions are on the <a href='http://github.com/w5xd/MK1101/wiki'>Wiki</a>.

The most current design is the MK-1104 with its 3D printed enclosure. An older design, from 2017, is the MK-1101 and MK-1102 which
fit into aluminum enclosures manufactured by Bud. All the devices are functionally identical and nearly so with the much older MK-1100
that was manufactured by HAL.

The TextFixture and the Arduino sketch are shared among all the designs.
