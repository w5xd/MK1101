Errata

1. The solder mask for the main board does NOT fit after the PCB is cut for the MK-1103 configuration. Therefore: do NOT cut the PCB
until AFTER the surface mount components are baked on.
2. C101 and C102 are too close to the paddles input connector. work around: the 3D printed enclosure accounts for the connector displacement
3. D13 at the 12V DC input is too close to the 12 Power input connector. It CANNOT be placed. work around: place it on the bottom 
side across the holes for the 12V input connector.
4. The biggest two mounting holes for the 9 pin D connector are too small in the PCB. The pins can be crushed with needle nose and forced in.

The only bottom-side components (besides the D13 issue above) are: 
    FT232H breakout
    Ptt out connectors
    RX audio in connectors (and these are only present in the MK-1104 configuration)
